This repo is my attempt at following [Fireship's](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) course on [Next.js 13 and the app router](https://fireship.io/courses/nextjs/).

The motivation behind taking this course was a desire to learn more about fullstack frameworks and about server rendering and its advantages and disadvantages over static pages, which represent all my projects in React so far.
